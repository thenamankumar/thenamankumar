title: On getting into Machine Learning
---
Having a passion to build products and solve problems since my earliest interactions with the internet in childhood, I have always focused on learning & developing skills to be able to fulfil my passion.

The journey started with building GUI applications in C++, along with writing blogs, and having fair share of fun with Adsense & SEO during my High School years. The initial experience with building things and seeing people use or at least appreciate them gave me a lot of joy and satisfaction which further fueled my motivation for years to come.

During the first year of college, I got an opportunity to work as a SEO consultant at Coding Blocks, which got converted into a Software Engineer Intern role based on my nominal web development skills. The opportunity helped me learn a lot and opened many doors for me. As a result, in first 3 years of college I gained 26 months on internship experience and finally got an early fulltime job at Product Hunt as a Fullstack Engineer.

It has been 6 years since my first stint at Coding Blocks. I was fortunate to meet and learn from a lot of amzing people in tech. I got opportunities to build applications from scratch, scale them, do a lot of experimentation and anlytics research. I have worked at both large scale firms and budding startups in multiple domains including ed-tech, e-commerce, dev-tooling and more.

The projects I am most proud of involved a lot of data analysis and playing with numbers. Along with building cool tech, analysing the user beahviour and improving the product accordingly, alawys captured my interest.

Having enough experience with Fullstack Engineering; to develop new skills and fulfil my keen interest in using data to build intelligent products, I thought of pursuing Executive Post Graduate Program in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence at IIIT Bangalore. It is a 13 months long program starting June 30th 2022.

I have started this blog to share my learnings & insights from the program and taking inspiration from my roles as a Fullstack Engineer and Data Analyst.

Stay tuned!
